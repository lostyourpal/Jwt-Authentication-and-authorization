# Jwt-Authentication-and-authorization
Using Spring 3.0, authorizing and authenticating user through JWT 
1. Introduction to JWT
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and 
authorization purposes in web applications and APIs. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.

2. How JWT Works
When a user logs in or authenticates in an application, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client. 
The client then includes this token in the header or payload of subsequent requests to authenticate itself to the server.

The server can verify the authenticity of the JWT by checking its signature. If the signature is valid, the server can trust the information 
contained in the payload of the token and grant access to the requested resources.


3. Authentication with JWT
JWT authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. When a user logs in, the server typically checks the provided credentials 
(e.g., username and password) and generates a JWT containing information about the authenticated user. This token is then returned to the client and stored,
usually in local storage or a cookie.

For each subsequent request, the client includes the JWT in the request headers. The server verifies the JWT's signature, checks the user's permissions,
and grants access if the token is valid and the user has the required permissions.

4. Authorization with JWT
JWT authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the user's permissions. The permissions or
roles of a user are typically stored in the token's payload. The server can extract this information and determine whether the user is authorized to
access the requested resource.

By including the user's permissions in the JWT payload, the server can perform authorization checks without needing to query a database or perform
additional validation steps. This makes JWT-based authorization efficient and scalable.

5. Implementing JWT in Your Application
To implement JWT authentication and authorization in your application, you'll need to follow these general steps:

-Choose a JWT library or framework compatible with your programming language.
-Generate a JWT on successful user authentication and include it in the response to the client.
-Store the JWT securely on the client-side (e.g., in local storage or a cookie).
-Include the JWT in the headers of subsequent requests to authenticate the client.
-On the server-side, verify the JWT's signature and extract the user's information and permissions from the payload.
-Perform authentication and authorization checks based on the extracted information.
-Grant or deny access to the requested resources based on the authorization checks.

6. Conclusion
JWT authentication and authorization provide a secure and scalable approach for protecting your web applications and APIs. By using JWTs, 
you can authenticate users and authorize their access to specific resources based on their roles or permissions. Understanding the concepts and implementing
JWT properly can help ensure the integrity and security of your application's authentication and authorization mechanisms.
